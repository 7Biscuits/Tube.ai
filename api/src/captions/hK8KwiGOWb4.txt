Hello! I'm Tom and today I'm going to show you how we really say hello to our friends in British English. If you're with your friends, you can say 'alright'. For example: Alright, Elly? You could also say 'hello, mate', but say it like this: Hello, mate! Another thing we could say is 'how are you doing'? But, we say it like this: How you doing? My favourite is 'what's happening', and you say it like this: Hey! What's happening? You can use any of these expressions when you meet British people and sound super natural. Excellent! So now you know how to use these new expressions, you can come and say hi to us on the BBC Learning English social media pages.
